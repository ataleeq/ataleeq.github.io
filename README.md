<b>BATH</b> is a crytpo token developed by SHIELD as an open source entity.</br>

Stay tuned, still much more to come. Join us if you feel passionate about it.</br>

<b>BATH Coin | Growing and stable at the same time</b> 

A stable, open source, decentralised coin which is not pegged to any fiat, metal or math calculations. BATH is stable in hard times and greener in good times. By Holding BATH, one can earn Bitcoin and BATH, whichever he likes more.</br>

<b>Our solution: </b></br>
Self sufficient financial system without any human interaction, a better version of Bitcoin in terms of openness, value and operations. A better 'value' determining model, transaction cost adjusting model and a better model to support stakeholders.</br>

A coin where anyone can earn founder-status by supporting the system.</br>

So All of you are invited and don't feel FOMO later. At SHIELD, we are starting from scratch and making it better and immune to fiat and crypto systems and their vulnerabilities.</br>
